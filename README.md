# Jwt_Auth
I successfully completed this project, which involved building a Django and React application where React is hosted on a separate server served by Express. Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into handling JWT authentication, ensuring secure storage of access and refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies to prevent unauthorized access by JavaScript. Additionally, I learned how to manage CORS and cookie settings to establish smooth communication between frontend and backend. To enhance navigation within the React app, I implemented React Router version 6 and utilized Redux Toolkit for efficient state management. Lastly, I leveraged proxies to streamline front-end development and facilitate communication with the backend API. This project has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the technologies involved and equipped me with practical knowledge to build robust and secure full-stack applications in the future.
